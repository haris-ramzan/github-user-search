[Github User Search] A React app to search for Github users and display their information.

I used `Reactjs`, `Css`, `HTML`, `styled-component`, `react-router-dom`

## Approach
I create my app from create-react-app boilerplate. I used styled-components for component creation and css. I also demonstrate the `JSS` styles in my code that we can also use JSS styles in our app. Apart from this, I used `react-router-dom(web)` for two pages navigation. In this app there is two pages one is specify for Search the user by `username` after navigate to result screen by clicking `Search` Button it shows the result of the `Users`.
